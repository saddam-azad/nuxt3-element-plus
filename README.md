[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/nuxt-3-element-plus)

Issues:

1. Dynamically hydrated `el-select` and `el-option` shows `[object Object]` as label. 

Expected behaviour: Select the first option and display appropriate label.

2. Form validation rules do not work. 

3. On Form Submit event, the `fields` property retuns `undefined`.
